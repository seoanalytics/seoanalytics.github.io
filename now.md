My personal mantra: move. think. create.

I've been interested in the web, in writing and storytelling since I was young. I enjoy hanging out at the intersection of digital art, science fiction, bike riding, digital media, strategy consulting, the beauty of mathematics and the essential joy of exercise.

Here's what I'm up to right now:

 - I run an independent consulting studio - specializing in [media design](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/07/25/media-design/), delivering [high fidelity consulting](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/07/10/high-fidelity-consulting/) through [strategy & stewardship](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/06/28/strategy-stewardship/).
 - Currently full through the end of 2018, though always happy to connect with interesting clients for 2019 and beyond. The best clients and projects have a long lead time so get in touch now for work next year!
 - September - December 2018 I'm following along the Maps as Media course at the New School as a satellite blogger. Follow [all my posts here](https://tomcritchlow.com/maps-as-media/). 
 - Connecting with and helping other independent folks building their own freelance/consulting pratice. See here: [the consultant's grain](http://tomcritchlow.com/2017/07/18/the-consultants-grain/) & [a fieldguide for independent consultants](https://tomcritchlow.com/2016/12/14/fieldguide-independent-consulting/)
 - Focusing on my blogging as an increasingly important and deliberate practice of networking and community. 
 - Being present and full of life for my 2.5 year old daughter.
 - Co-creating an <a href="http://www.fiercelycurious.com">art business</a> for Brooklyn artists with my partner [Erin](http://erinprz.com/)
 - One day, maybe, launching a science fiction publishing company
 
In the past I've done a lot of conference speaking - I'm open to new speaking opportunities so get in touch if you have an event you'd like me to speak at.

I'm always looking to grab coffee with interesting people so get in touch: <a href="mailto:tjcritchlow@gmail.com">tjcritchlow@gmail.com</a>
