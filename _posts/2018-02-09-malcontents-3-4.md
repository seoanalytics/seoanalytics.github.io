[The Malcontents](http://themalcontents.fm/) is a podcast all about the world of content by myself and my good friend Sean Blanda.

I've been lax with the show notes so there's two episodes to catch up on.

## Episode 4 - Tom and Sean interview each other

Episode 4 was a lot of fun! We realized that for new listeners that might not know a lot about one or both of us we should explain a little about who we are, what we do and why we're nutso for content!

## Episode 5 - Hiring and careers in content

This episode Sean and I get down to actionable insights into building a content team - from both sides. How do you think about building an editorial team? Should you hire fulltimers or freelancers? And then we get into the other side - how do you ace an interview for a content position? What questions might come up? (and yes, we tell you to start a blog!)
