title: Creativity vs Innovation
subtitle: Innovation is implemented ideas

> Well, the key point is you can’t mix, you know, words. Creativity is not innovation. Creativity is idea generation. And, you know, you might create a lot of ideas smoking pot or sitting in a room, but innovation is implemented ideas. Innovation is ideas that come to marketplace. - [John Sullivan](https://spectrum.ieee.org/podcast/at-work/tech-careers/telecommuting-and-yahoos-desperate-need-for-innovation)

I love this quote. Simply stated and to the point. Note that if you’re paying attention and feeling altruistic you don’t care if YOU bring them to the marketplace, just that SOMEONE brings them to the marketplace.
