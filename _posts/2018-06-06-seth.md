Celebration. Too much of the internet (and certainly social media) is spent dunking on people and criticizing things. But in the old days of blogging there was a lot of "hey this is good, go check it out!".

So in homage to one of the most incredible blogging feats out there and to the olden days of blogging - congrats Seth!

Seth Godin recently launched a podcast Akimbo which is lovely (I especially like the double bass jazz notes) and his latest episode is all about blogging:

He also announced that he's moved his blog (of 16 years!) from Typepad to Wordpress. It looks great:

So congrats on the new site. Congrats on the podcast. Thank you for keeping going.

And, a good reminder to all of us about the quiet force of a blogging habit stuck to over time
