subtitle: Why scrappy remixing and copy pasting is how I get around on the web
---

I just moved this site over to the [Tachyons CSS framework](http://tachyons.io/). Why? Because I can. It's a framework that is pretty easy to get started with and it allows you to build front-end code easily and extensibly. I'm probably not using it right but I don't care - it helped me get some stuff on the web.

And this site only uses one font and one color (ok, plus a grey for the footer and a black for the font).

The color I'm using is #00ff00. Why? Because it's the default "neon green" in Google Docs.

Yes, you read that right - [I do all my designing in Google Docs](https://medium.com/@tomcritchlow/how-to-use-google-slides-as-a-free-cloud-hosted-illustrator-replacement-f472e6c3a881). If that surprises you, wait till you find out I also do [most of my coding in Google Docs](https://www.distilled.net/blog/distilled/guide-to-google-docs-importxml/).

See how far this rabbit hole goes?

## The Web Is Confusing for Beginners

I'm constantly looking for ways to get things done. I hate formalized workflows that get in the way. Have you ever seen something that looks fun on the web only to be greeted with something like this:

Oh, bower! Ok. Let's see what that is:

This rabbit hole ain't looking so good...

## Things should be easier

Next time you're writing documentation or instructions remember the context people have. The web is a vast and weird place - plenty of smart people aren't using what you consider "obvious" solutions. Many people are still coding in excel. That's totally fine. The web is a remix and designed to be messy and extensible.

## Look for the edges

So where are the next edges? Publishing - I'm experimenting with [blurb](http://www.blurb.com/) and [lulu](https://www.lulu.com/) and some others to figure out fast ways to get things printed (hint - using Google Slides for layout and exporting as PDF).

I'm experimenting with using [tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) to use Google Docs as a database to publish interactive content.

I'm experimenting with [dexter](https://rundexter.com/) to build simple bots.

I've not really used it yet but [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) looks amazing as a way to build simple interactive web experiences. (Gotta learn node first though....)

What are your hacks? Where are your edges? How are you using tools in ways they weren't designed?
