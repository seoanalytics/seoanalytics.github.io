Hi there. I've been toying with the idea of starting a semi-regular breakfast series for a while and I'm finally getting it off the ground. If you're passionate about content, writing, CMSs, blogging or publishing for the web please come along!

**Next breakfast**: Nov 9th, 8.30am at [61 local](https://www.google.com/maps/place/61+Local/@40.6870183,-73.9931875,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c25a4e27835eb9:0xf5363cbf2f84b91c!8m2!3d40.6870183!4d-73.9909988).

It's nice and informal. Though I do have a logo:

*(Note, it won't always be in Brooklyn. If you have suggestions for somewhere in Manhattan to get together please let me know!)*
