title: Using Facebook Messenger as a Free Intercom Replacement
subtitle: 
---

Up until yesterday I used Intercom to run a livechat experience on [Fiercely Curious](http://www.fiercelycurious.com), an online art startup that I run. But it costs $50 / month and the mobile app for iOS was acting up not always delivering notifications so I decided to play around and see if I could replicate the functionality using Facebook Messenger.

The result - success! (with some quirks). Here's the experience showing a Facebook chat call to action:

And here's the experience when you engage with the button:

I had a few people asking how I did it so I wanted to share the code. It's nothing complicated and I'm sure there are more efficient ways of presenting this so I hope by sharing it we can improve the experience!

Here's the HTML code on every page of the site: 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/tomcritchlow/493774b09b02e31d1184d7cda926c659.js"></script>

And the accompanying CSS:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/tomcritchlow/ec36371f80ceaa1fab73f7d1db539f7e.js"></script>

I'm excited to play in this space - clearly the experience is subpar for those users who don't have a Facebook account or even just aren't logged in but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make for now. I think Facebook will build out more robust tools for businesses that want to use messenger as a tool for customer interaction.

Try it out right now: [fiercelycurious.com](http://www.fiercelycurious.com)!

Any feedback? Got a suggestion to improve the experience? Let me know!
