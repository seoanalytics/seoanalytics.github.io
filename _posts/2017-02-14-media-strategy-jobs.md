A few interesting strategy roles for media companies have come across my feeds recently so I thought I'd post them all in one place in case anyone is looking.

>Quartz Creative is the in-house creative shop at Quartz. We help brands make interesting and effective “things” for people, designed for the ways they live and experience media. We’re part of the Quartz family (qz.com, Daily Brief, Quartz App, Quartz AI, Quartz Bot Studio). We put the user at the center of our thinking, and our work.

>We are looking for a high-energy, fast-paced creative and strategic doer to help guide our clients into new spaces and big ideas. We want a curious mind who researches like an academic and writes like a screenwriter. Equal parts analytical and imaginative, with a nose for insights that can inspire creative opportunities, and a storyteller’s instinct for delivery.

>The Newsroom Strategy team is looking for new members to help the newsroom design, structure and implement crucial changes in our report and the ways we work.

>As a member of the team, you’ll serve as an advisor, problem solver and project manager in transformation efforts big and small. A few of the team’s current and upcoming projects include helping to develop new approaches to editing, reimagine the print newspaper and accelerate the expansion of visual journalism, among other elements of Dean and Joe’s recent action plan for the year ahead.

>Vox Media is a technology-driven media company. We're solving the problem of developing high-value digital journalism, storytelling, and brand advertising at scale—and empowering the most talented web voices and their audiences with Chorus, our modern media platform. We got our start innovating in sports media with SB Nation, the largest and fastest-growing network of fan-centric online sports communities. We now have eight brands including Polygon, The Verge, Vox.com, Curbed, Racked, Eater, and Recode.

>We believe in building loyal audiences that come together around topics they love and voices they seek out. We are seeking a creative and experienced Director of Editorial Growth who will further develop our passionate communities, as well as reach new audiences across multiple platforms. As Director of Editorial Growth, you will work with all eight of our media brands, and you will be charged with innovating on both our product and our editorial strategies to make our brands the preeminent destinations for smart, curious audiences everywhere.
