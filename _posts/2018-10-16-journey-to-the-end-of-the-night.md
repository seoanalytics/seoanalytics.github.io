title: Who do I know in the kids book publishing world?
subtitle: Erin's first illustrated book - Journey To The End Of The Night
---

For the love of Erin and the love of books! My partner Erin has been working for the past year and half on painting, illustrating and writing a kids book called **Journey To The End Of The Night**.

I'm biased obviously but.... It's wonderful! Everyone she shows it to instantly wants a copy. Early reviews talk about it's "swoosh energy".

Here's the front cover:

And a couple of spreads:

So. Dear network, here's the ask - who do I know in the kids book publishing world that you can connect me to?

The book is pretty much completely done and self-publishing is definitely an option (an attractive one even) but first it would be nice to explore finding an agent / publisher that might want to take it.

If you know anyone - drop me a note or an intro to: tjcritchlow@gmail.com

The book has a little webpage here: [http://erinprz.com/journey/](http://erinprz.com/journey/)

And Erin has started a tinyletter where she'll show a few behind the scenes images and notes on the process sign up here: [tinyletter.com/erinprz](https://tinyletter.com/erinprz)
