title: PDF Aesthetics
subtitle: A publishing manifesto
---

Publishing a PDF is an act of rebellion. They work on every device. But they work perfectly on none. It's there on mobile but you have to pinch pinch pinch. There's no rules or grids or frameworks for publishing a PDF. They can look any way, polished or xeroxed. Big or small. PDFs will outlive Facebook. They are the cockroaches of media that will be here long after we're gone. They're ugly and dirty.

But their aesthetics are beautiful. Brutalist publishing that exposes the raw materials.
