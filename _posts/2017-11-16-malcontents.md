subtitle: A pilot for a thing that might become a podcast...

My friend [Sean Blanda](http://seanblanda.com/) and I were chatting about the content industry and our ideas for making it better, our frustrations with how people talk and think about it and more and it occurred to us that perhaps a podcast would be worth doing?

Sean came up with the name **The Malcontents** and a podcast was born...

We recorded a pilot episode with zero prep or technical setup - we recorded it on Anchor.fm and you can listen to it here:

We talk about:

- Always own your own platform
- Every page is a landing page
- Machine-created content
- Race to the bottom of sameness
- Bonus: Site of the week
    - Tom's: [Dark Matter](https://tinyletter.com/ianfitzpatrick)
    - Sean's: [Substack](https://www.substack.com/)

We hope you enjoy it! Overall I'm pretty happy with how it came out (interruptions and general flailing aside) and I think we might record a few more...
