title: Re-booting the Malcontents Podcast and Looking for Feedback
subtitle: Iterating on the model
---

So a few months back Sean Blanda and I started a little podcast series called [The Malcontents](http://themalcontents.fm/).

After 5 episodes (well, there were 6 but zencastr completely ruined the sixth episode) we petered out. Both our lives got busy and the project stalled.

But! I really enjoyed making the podcast and we've been discussing re-booting it and have some ideas about how to do that.

We know we need guests so it's not just Sean and I.

We know we need better production quality.

We know we need to be (slightly) less grouchy.

What else?

Where else could we take this?

If you listened to any of the early episodes - I'd love your feedback as we think through format, content, guests, brand etc. Leave a note in the comments - we'd love to hear from you!
