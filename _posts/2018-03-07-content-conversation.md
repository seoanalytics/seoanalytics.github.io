subtitle: A fireside chat about effecting change

I had tons of fun recording this video with Ross Hudgens of [Siege Media](https://www.siegemedia.com/) - we collaborate on some client projects and I love the work Siege does and I love how Ross thinks about content.

And Corey and I go way back to when I first moved to NYC. Now he's running [Factorial Digital](http://factorialdigital.com/) and is one of the very few folks in the SEO/content space that thinks about actual "consulting" within organizations.

Check it out - we loosen up about 20 mins in (and there's some fun outtakes!)
