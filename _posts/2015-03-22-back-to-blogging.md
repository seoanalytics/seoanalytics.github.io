Hello blogging. It's been a while since we've seen each other.

Welcome to my redesigned blog, hosted on Github pages using Jekyll.

I'm going to be (aspring to) write more here, now that I have a place to put my writing that I feel happy with. I've been resolving the problem of HAVING A BLOG by seamlessly mixing my tomcritchlow.com blogging with other writing I do elsewhere, be it Medium or elsewhere.

In an age of decentralized brands I'm feeling happier about calling this site a home without it being the ONLY place I have to write on.

Much love - if you have something you'd like to see me write about just get in touch.

Tom xx
