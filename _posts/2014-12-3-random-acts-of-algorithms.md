title: Random Acts of Algorithms
---

[This is a repost of an article that originally appeared on my Svbtle blog in June 2012. I’m reposting here for posterity]

A little while back I built Fuck Yeah Spotify as an experiment in music discovery - it was designed to aggregate the top 20 tweeted Spotify albums each day.

The problem is that it doesn’t work. Well, rather it doesn’t work like I intended…

Instead, the site somehow finds a somewhat random collection of Spotify albums and posts them. It’s been doing this every day for a year and a half and I love the site dearly. It matches my intent perfectly - surfacing music I’d never otherwise have found.

This all came to a head on June 24th when the algorithms found this random collection of albums:

24th June on Fuck Yeah Spotify

Included on the list was *Stuck between the devil and the blues in drop C by Kill Kasper*

Jamie the front man of Kill Kasper reached out to me to ask how his album made it onto the list:

> Hello,
>
> Yesterday (24th June 2012) our EP release (Stuck between the devil and the blues in drop C by Kill Kasper) ended up on your most shared list, along with the likes of The Smashing Pumpkins and Linkin park…
>
> We only told a few mates about it, and none of us use twitter!!! We couldn’t find anything searching twitter either, so I thought I’d ask… How the fuck did we end up on your most shared list??? :))
>
> Much Love…
>
> Jamie K, confused (but very happy) front man!

In truth I had no idea but I’m glad that I was able to make him happy for one day at least. Our email exchange ended like this:

“Your broken algorithm, made my day, I’m glad you didn’t fix it :)"
The least we can do is all go listen to the EP right? It’s kind of good. Check it on myspace here or on Spotify.

## Celebrate the Broken, Obscure and Random Things In Life

I have no desire to “fix” my site. I like it just like it is - in the same way I loved my first radio as a kid. It didn’t work quite like I wanted but it was *mine* and that meant something.

I have an aversion to things that “just work” - I prefer things that I can relate to and sometimes I’m broken, obscure and irrational.

We should celebrate those things and **this post is dedicated to everything that doesn’t quite work properly in this world but that we love dearly anyway**.
