If you missed it, my friend [Sean Blanda](http://seanblanda.com/) and I started a podcast called **The Malcontents**. It's somewhat (ok, very) experimental but we had a good reaction to episode 1 so we made another!

- This article on [fake ad networks](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fake-ad-operation-used-to-steal-from-publishers-is-uncovered-1511290981)
- Why Tom likes Stratechery so much
- This article about a [digital media crash](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/theres-a-digital-media-crash-but-no-one-will-say-it)
- Bonus: Site of the week
    - Tom's: [Nieman Lab](http://www.niemanlab.org/)
