This was a project I ran at Google as a marketing.hmm

I still struggle with the underlying agenda of STEM education - everyone that worked on the project at Google had liberal arts degrees (except me! with a maths degree). STEAM is the way forward. But either way I love the fact that we inspired millions of young people to make, tinker, hack and experiment.
