title: Conference Speaking
---

I love the opportunity to speak at conferences. If blogging is networked writing then conferences feel like networked conversations. I've been to incredible places around the world (I think I've spoken at conferences on 4 continents!) and met some wonderful people.

A few recent speaking gigs:
- Distilled SearchLove San Diego 2017 ([link to slides](http://tomcritchlow.com/2017/02/24/the-state-of-media/))
- Inbounder World Tour, NYC 2017
- Dominus Capital CEO Retreat, WI 2017
- MozCon Seattle head to head with Rand Fishkin 2012 ([link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsVY10ubnZo))

If you're interested in having me speak at an event just drop me a note: tjcritchlow@gmail.com
