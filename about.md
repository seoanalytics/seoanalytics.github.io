Hi there, I’m currently helping businesses define and build digital marketing capabilities as an independent consultant. I’m also championing Brooklyn artists as co-founder of art startup [Fiercely Curious](http://www.fiercelycurious.com).

## How I Got Here

In 2007 I joined my brother’s small digital agency, [Distilled](http://www.distilled.net), and made tinkering with SEO, content and digital strategy a business. 1 office turned into 3, NYC became home base, the business became what is known as “known.” 

I learned a couple things along the way. 

- Business consulting is about taking ownership and getting close to the problem and close to the people.
- Effecting change is hard and momentum is the key to success.
- Managing and hiring people is rooted in unlocking potential, not judging performance

As the internet evolved so did I and I found myself joining Google’s Creative Lab in 2012 where I worked on a wide range of strategic projects from producing a live action video about the future of search to presenting a new business model for Google to Larry Page. I also ran my first TV ad, worked with NASA, The White House and made a bunch of gifs.
  
After two years at Google I realized that innovation was more exciting and faster in incubators and loose creative communities so I left Google, launched [Fiercely Curious](http://www.fiercelycurious.com) and began an independent consulting practice working with media organizations and startups on growth, marketing, audience development and more.

I'm currently obsessed with the media landscape and how startups, agencies and media organizations are creating and distributing content across the web.  

## Knowledge Sharing & Teaching

A consistent theme across my work has been sharing knowledge and helping to teach others. I wrote some [guides to crawling the web using Google Docs](https://www.distilled.net/blog/distilled/guide-to-google-docs-importxml/) back in 2011 and get very excited about new ways for non-technical folks to engage with the web in a deeper way.

Maybe because of my british accent I've been a mentor for various startup accelerators and incubators and spoken at conferences on 4 continents. More on my [speaking here](http://tomcritchlow.com/speaking).
