>But the sea
which no one tends
is also a garden

[Asphodel, That Greeny Flower by William Carlos Williams](http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/asphodel-greeny-flower-excerpt)

>First, The fish needs to say, “Something ain’t right about this Camel ride – And I’m Feeling so damn Thirsty.”

Hafiz

>And we all say: OH!
Well I never!
Was there ever
A Cat so clever
As Magical Mr. Mistoffelees!

[Mr Mistophelees by TS Eliot](http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/t__s__eliot/poems/15147)

>So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing.
Whisper of running streams, and winter lightning.

[The Four Quartets by TS Eliot](http://www.coldbacon.com/poems/fq.html)

>In the summer
I stretch out on the shore
And think of you
Had I told the sea
What I felt for you,
It would have left its shores,
Its shells,
Its fish,
And followed me.
 
Nizar Qabbani

>But after a time allowed for it to swim,
Instead of proving human when it neared
And someone else additional to him,
As a great buck it powerfully appeared,
Pushing the crumpled water up ahead,
And landed pouring like a waterfall,
And stumbled through the rocks with horny tread,
And forced the underbrush--and that was all.

[The Most of It by Robert Frost](http://genius.com/Robert-frost-the-most-of-it-annotated)

>We are, I am, you are
by cowardice or courage
the one who find our way
back to this scene
carrying a knife, a camera
a book of myths
in which
our names do not appear.

[Diving into the wreck by Adrienne Rich](http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/diving-wreck)
