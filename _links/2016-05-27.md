link: Deeply thought provoking, <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/04/portrait-motherhood-creativity-c-v-r.html?mid=fb-share-thecut">a portrait of the artist as a young mom</a>. As new parents I'm thinking a lot about how to keep a creative practice for both of us, but especially for the Mum.
quote: Her experience of sacrifice and loss might seem extreme, but among the women I spoke with, it wasn’t uncommon. What was more unusual were women who were willing to talk about ways in which they accepted that their devotion to art made them, at least at times, less of a parent. One of those was writer and mother Zoe Zolbrod. Like me, she has two children. Like me, she is about to publish a book she struggled to write through the early years of motherhood. We talk about the various challenges of writing, parenting, working a day job, stealing time. “The truth,” she says, “is that I think I’m a better mom when I’m not writing. I’m not writing right now and I’m enjoying the kids more. I’m better at home when I’m writing less.”
