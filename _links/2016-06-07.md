quote: What emerges from this visualization is a clear picture of four distinct classes of content on the New York Timesâ€™ site - (A) Wire articles which never reached the homepage, (B) Original articles which never reached the homepage, (C) Wire content which is featured on the homepage for a short period of time, and (D) Original content which receives promotion on both the homepage and across social media. While groups A and B encompass a wide variety of outcomes, groups C and B generally display a positive linear relationship between time on homepage and pageviews.
