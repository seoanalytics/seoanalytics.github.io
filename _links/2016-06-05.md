link: Seth Godin on the difference between <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-freelancer-and-the-entrepreneur-c79d2bbb52b2#.8n7u93yi4">the freelancer and the entrepreneur</a>.
quote: The trap is simple - Sometime freelancers get entrepreneur-envy and start hiring other freelancers to work for them. This doesn’t scale. Managing freelancers is different from being a freelancer. Managing freelancers and saving the best projects for yourself gets you into trouble. The cash flow gets you into trouble. Investors don’t want to invest in you because you can’t sell out if you’re a freelancer at heart
